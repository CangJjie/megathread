## How to translate:

All translations are welcome, we don't really expect much from a PR right now, but please keep these in mind before you begin:

- Try to keep it decent, we don't want *actual* native speakers to be confused with half-baked translations, so atleast have basic knowledge of said language. Also, you are not allowed to use translators like Google Translate.

- You are not allowed to add your own stuff in, nor allowed to upload files or modify the format, it **must** be 1:1 exact to this repo excepting translations.

- You are supposed to update/manage it whenever the main repo updates with an Pull Request, if you miss out on atleast 3 updates, your translation will be removed.

Finally, when you are done, you can fork the repo, rename README.md to README_(language-name-here, Example: README_IN.md).md and edit the contents, PR it with the Translations label and we will take a look when we get time, thanks again!
