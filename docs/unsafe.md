You can just use the FMHY Unsafe Sites/Software adblock filter on uBlacklist (more efficient) and
uBlock Origin to block most of the sites mentioned here and more. Follow
[this guide](https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/docs/advanced-features#subscription) to add the
custom filter to uBlacklist (put
[this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privateersclub/wiki/master/unsafe_uBlacklist.txt)
under "URL") and
[this guide](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-add-custom-filters)
to add it to uBlock Origin (use
[this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privateersclub/wiki/master/unsafe_uBlock.txt) under
